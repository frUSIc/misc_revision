Network sizes:
- LAN: Within organisation or physical location
- WAN: Geographically dispersed
- Internet: Global set of interconnected WANs

Basic requirement of network is to send data from A to B regardless of distance
Needs:
- Address of destination
- Route to get to destination
- Get processed at intermediate nodes
- Follow certain protocols

Files are divided into packets and travels through physical link through nodes, reaches destination and gets processed (re-ordered, error checking, buffering) then is completely 'sent'.

OSI layers
7. Application
6. Presenation
5. Session
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link
1. Physical

Can also look at the 5 layer model
1. Physical: Wires, fibre optics, radio, etc.
2. Link Layer: Ethernet, MAC addressing, CSMA
3. Network layer: Routing protocols, IP
4. Transport Layer: TCP/UDP
5. Application Layer: DNS, HTTP, email

Packets are encapsulated from all lower layers, e.g. IP headers wrap TCP/UDP headers wrap HTTP requests
Each layer encapsulates one aspect of network transport, and eases maintenance/updating of each layer.

Network protocols govern communication activity, setting out standards and are defined in all layers.
Higher level layers typically have wider variety of protocols.

Network Application Layer
Directly supports apps users interact with such as email, web, VoIP, etc.

Client-Server Architecture is usually implemented via sockets
Servers must have unique Internet-wide address, containing IP address of the host machine and the port number the server is listening on:
e.g. 127.0.0.1:80

There are standardised port numbers:
22: ssh
80: http
443: https

IPv4 uses four 32-bit numbers. IPv6 uses eight 128-bit numbers.
